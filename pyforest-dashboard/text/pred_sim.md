The figures above show contrasting pixel-wise probability rasters of deforestation against corresponding simulations to illustrate the influence of land use plans on the model's predictive power. 

In a more detailed examination of the influence of the LUP, we can observe distinct patterns across different categories. In all scenarios, the outlines of the various categories within the LUP are discernible, and they generally exhibit higher probabilities in areas designated for deforestation. However, these areas also display a range of probabilities, with some spots nearing a probability of 1, indicating almost certain deforestation, and others hovering around 0.33, suggesting a lower but still significant risk.

Interestingly, lower probabilities are observed in protected areas, reflecting the effectiveness of these zones in mitigating deforestation. Additionally, we notice patterns that suggest the influence of geographical and environmental factors.
